- ⚡ Fun fact: 
Did you know that octopuses have three hearts? Two of them pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. When an octopus swims,
 the heart that delivers blood to the body actually stops beating, which is why they prefer crawling over swimming to conserve energy!
